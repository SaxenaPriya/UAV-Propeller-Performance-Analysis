# UAV-Propeller-Performance-Analysis
Capstone project for analyzing UAVs performance using XGBoost machine learning model and storytelling via Tableau.
**Prroject Tile** - UAV Propeller Performance Analysis 
**Problem Statement** - The growing demand for small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in civil and military applications necessitates addressing challenges in propulsion system optimization. Designing efficient propellers for small UAVs involves navigating trade-offs in size, power, and weight against range and endurance requirements. This project aims to understand and overcome aerodynamic complexities unique to small UAVs, enhancing their overall performance and adaptability.
**Technologies Used** - XGBoost model is used for taining 3 models, Python is used for model developement, sql in Python is used for querring abd Tableau is used for storytelling.
**Running the notebook** - can be run on any IDE by simply saving the code in to the system.
**Results** - out of the 3 models developed Model B is best with highest RÂ² and lowest RMSE![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eb9740c-2861-4808-9df8-9d9c61d52f0c)
